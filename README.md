## Naming conventions

### React

#### Resources

Say you want to add a posts concept to your app. Users should be able to perform CRUD operations. How should you structure your routes and pages?

For each action, you should add helpers to generate routes which map to pages as follows:

 - `postsPath => '/posts' => PostsPage`: View all posts
 - `postsNewPath => '/posts/new' => PostsNewPage`:  Create a new post
 - `postsDeletePath => '/posts/delete' => PostsDeletePage`: Perform delete on a collection of posts
 - `postsActionPath => '/posts/action' => PostsActionPage`: Perform an action on a collection of posts
 - `postPath => '/posts/:id' => PostPage`: View a post
 - `postEditPath => '/posts/:id/edit' => PostEditPage(id)`: Edit a post
 - `postDeletePath => '/posts/:id/delete' => PostDeletePage(id)`: Delete a post
 - `postActionPath => '/posts/:id/action' => PostActionPage(id)`: Perform an action on a post

Note this is very similar to how Rails does routing, however, we deliberately but the action after the resource for sorting.

All components corresponsing to pages should be in the `./pages/` directory or nested by resource (e.g. `./pages/posts/`)

Nested resources follow the same convention above:

 - `userPostsPath => 'users/:userId/posts' => UsersPostsPage(userId)`: View all posts for this user
 - `userPostPath => 'users/:userId/posts/:id' => UserPostsPage(userId, id)`: View a post by this user


Again components corresponsing to pages should be in the `./pages` directory. If you want to create a separate folder, follow the same pattern as before but do not nest (e.g. `./pages/usersPosts/`).

#### Shared Components

React components that are shared across pages in a single app go in the `./components` directory.
