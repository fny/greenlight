Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (</span><span class="c0">&ldquo;Notice&rdquo;</span><span class="c1">) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to the Company should be sent to the Company attn..: Terms of Use Dispute at the address listed in Section 10.8 (or such other address as may be provided by the Company for this purpose. After the Notice is received, you and the Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally. If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c8 c2">Arbitration</span><span class="c1">. You agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising hereunder or relating in any way to these Terms and not informally resolved shall be settled by binding arbitration in Raleigh, North Carolina, in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">AAA</span><span class="c1">&rdquo;).

The party filing a claim or counterclaim in the arbitration proceeding shall pay the deposit(s) determined by AAA with respect to such claim or counterclaim. All other costs associated with the arbitration and imposed by AAA shall be paid as determined by the arbitrator(s) and, in absence of such determination, equally by each party to the arbitration. &nbsp;In addition, unless the arbitrator awards payment of reasonable attorney and other fees to a party, each party to the arbitration shall be responsible for its own attorneys&#39; fees and other professional fees incurred in connection with the arbitration. Determinations of the arbitrator will be final and binding upon the parties to the arbitration, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for a judicial acceptance of the award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be. The arbitrator shall apply the substantive law of the State of North Carolina, without giving effect to its conflict of laws rules.</span></li><li class="c3"><span class="c8 c2">Waiver of Jury Trial. </span><span class="c1">THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement.
